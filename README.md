# ClusterClassification_Prac 

In this project, I'm exploring cluster classification. Clustering consists of grouping a set of objects in such a way 
that objects in the same group or cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering is 
an unsupervised classification method because you don't have any prior classification/response variable associated with your data.

Using the dataset of cncb dataset in 2021, I'm showcasing the k-means algorithm, testing for clusterability, and
the relevance of standardization and feature importance.
