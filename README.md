ClusterClassification

During my unsupervised machine learning class, we explored different concepts. In this project, I'm exploring cluster classification. 
Clustering consists of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group or cluster are more similar to each other 
than to those in other clusters. Clustering is an Unsupervised Classification method because you don't have any prior
classification/response variable associated with your data.

In Business Analytics we are typically interested in the resulting groups. This includes the
        a)The choice of an appropriate distance metric will influence the shape of the clusters;
        b)Some elements may be close to one another according to one distance and
        c)farther away according to another.

Using the dataset of cncb dataset in 2021, I'm showcasing the K-means algorithm, testing for clusterability, and
the relevance of standardization and feature importance.
